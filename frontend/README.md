### Manual Sign-Up (For Users Who Do Not Own The Game)
If you are a user who wants to test the web application, but do not own the Forza Horizon 5 game, you can create an account manually using the Signup page. After inputting your information into the Signup form, use the username you created the account with in place for areas of the web application where it asks for a gamertag. For example, on the home page of the web application it asks to "Enter gamertag" in order to look up your stats, but in this case you will enter the username you created your account with in place of the gamertag. This will allow you to view your manually created stats.
